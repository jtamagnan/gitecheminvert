Our small village of Pontlevoy is located between the 2 peaceful
valleys of the Loire and the Cher. For your days of discovery, the
castles of Chenonceau, Chaumont (and its garden festival), Cheverny,
Blois, Chambord are a few dozen kilometers away as well as the Beauval
Park Zoo. About thirty minutes away, you'll find the small town of
Amboise and the Clos Luce where Leonardo da Vinci lived at the end of
his days. There are many hiking and cycling trails (Loire à Vélo,
Châteaux à Vélo etc ...) that await the bravest. As you can see, our
beautiful Touraine is steeped in history, and you can choose to visit
a little or a lot but we also advise you to taste our wines, to swim
or simply to laze around.
